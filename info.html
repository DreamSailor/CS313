                 <p>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest 
                     fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our 
                     light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask 
                     ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, 
                     fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child 
                     of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There 
                     is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people
                     won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, 
                     as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of 
                     God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in 
                     everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we 
                     unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. 
                     As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence 
                     automatically liberates others.
