            <p>The purpose of this assignment is to review a minimal level of client-side programming and 
                provide a homepage from which you can link to future assignments.</p>

            <h5>Description:</h5>
            <p>Should have a professional look and feel. Please write the HTML for this page from scratch. 
            You are, however, welcome to use jQuery, or Bootstrap, etc.  Put all styles in an external 
            stylesheet. (No inline styles.) Have at least two pages: one as an introduction to yourself 
            and one that will have links to assignments.  Have at least one image as well as something 
            dynamic (e.g., mouse-overs, menus, on-click, on-change, etc.) Include reasonable colors, 
            images, etc. to show your creativity and personality.  Finally have no run-time errors.</p>

          <h5>Title: Assignment 2 - PHP Survey</h5>
          <h5>Date: Week 2</h5>
          <br>
          <h5>Objective:</h5>
            <p>Create a simple PHP form that allows users to cast votes for certain questions and see the results.</p>
            
            <h5>Description:</h5>
            <p>Your survey/results should look professional. There should be at least four questions. 
                Provide a link on the question page to go directly to the results (without voting). 
                When the user casts their vote, they should then see the results. 
                Store the results to a file on the filesystem so they can be retrieved/added to later. 
                If the user returns to the question page after they have voted, 
                they should be automatically directed to the results. </p>
